STITT = Sanskrit-Tibetan Interlinear Translation Tool
This is a program that allows language translators to work on interlinear texts. It includes fields for source texts, langauge correspondences, glosses, translations, and notes.
It was originally designed for working on Sanskrit and Tibetan editions of Buddhist texts, but it can easily be edited to fit other uses. It is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program functions even if you have no internet connection.
